                    <p>The diversity of life in Vermont is a beautiful mess. For centuries, humans have documented and celebrated the vast web of biodiversity that helps define the nature of this green state. Yet, on this journey of discovery, we have only taken the first few steps.</p>
<p><strong>That aim of this report is to document the current state of biodiversity in Vermont as of 2022 and how it may change in the future given climate change.</strong></p>
<p>Enumerating the species that live within Vermont is no simple task. For some groups of organisms, like birds, we have a pretty good understanding of which species occur within Vermont and the habitats where each species can be found. It turns out that birds are relatively easy to count, and find because they move around and make noise. In addition, many species are conspicuous and can be identified by either sight or sound. It helps that only 400 species have ever been observed in Vermont. Contrast that with insects, where we’ve found previously undescribed species that are new to science in our surveys. Even they may be relatively easy to count compared to Vermont&rsquo;s single-celled organisms, bacteria, and viruses.</p>

                    <p>The simplest way to estimate biodiversity is to count the number of species that live within a defined area. This method almost certainly underestimates the number of species since many species move, may be unavailable to count at the time when surveys were conducted, or simply missed or potentially misidentified. As such, lots of data are needed to overcome known shortcomings associated with accurately counting species. For simplicity, we don’t account for the potential of misidentified species or imperfect detection in this report. Instead, we used the 7,667,537 observations from 11,993 taxa submitted to various online platforms of species within Vermont by scientists, enthusiasts, and community scientists (GBIF.org downloaded 13 April 2022, <a href="https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.j53x2g)">https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.j53x2g)</a>. These occurrence records are the backbone of this report - without these species observations submitted by people across Vermont, this report would not have been possible.</p>
