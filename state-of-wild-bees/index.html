While many of these sites are conserved, rare bees are generally not included in management plans and could potentially benefit from targeted management of foraging and nesting resources.</p></section></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-scroll/>Design</a> template
