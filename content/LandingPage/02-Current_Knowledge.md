Thanks to the efforts of thousands of community scientists and biologists, <b>Vermont is one of the few states that has a relatively complete assessment of the bee fauna</b>. Together, weâ€™ve recorded wild bee species in nearly every one of the 255 towns, allowing us to <b>develop a conservation watch list</b>, identify regions of <a href="" target=blank_>unique bee communities</a> and designate <a href="" target=blank_>important bee areas</a> to help target conservation actions. Despite our collective efforts, we still lack robust population monitoring and key natural history information for many bee species.
