Our understanding of Vermont’s wild bees is a work in progress. Additional surveys, population monitoring, adaptive management, and a better understanding of their natural history is sorely needed. Over a century of information gleaned from historic natural history collections and surveys conducted across the state during the last decade provide us with a rich baseline to prioritize and implement conservation actions now.
