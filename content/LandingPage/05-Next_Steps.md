    Although we have learned a lot over the last decade, our understanding of Vermont’s wild bees remains a work in progress. Additional surveys, population monitoring, adaptive management, and a better understanding of their natural history are sorely needed. Over a century of information gleaned from historic natural history collections and surveys conducted across the state during the last decade provide us with a rich baseline to prioritize and implement conservation actions now. Collaborations between scientists, public agencies, conservation organizations, land owners, land managers, and even honey bee keepers will be necessary to effectively protect Vermont’s diverse bee fauna now and for future generations.
