  <h4>55 species and 12 Important Bee Areas identified as high conservation priorities</h4>

    <p>
      Armed with a robust assessment of the status of most wild bee species in Vermont, we are now able to suggest locations, habitats, and individual species that should be the highest priority for bee conservation efforts. We have developed a conservation watch list that includes 55 native bee species. Many of these species are regional specialties found nowhere else in the region and Vermont plays an outsized role in ensuring their global survival. We modeled the distribution of most bee species in Vermont, allowing us to identify important habitats and areas with unique and diverse bee communities. Some of these areas we have proposed as Important Bee Areas, priority locations for protection and bee-focused land management.
