Increasing temperature and extreme weather are among the greatest long-term threats to biodiversity, with bees being no exception. The possible implications are nearly infinite, ranging from phenological mis-match to reduced overwintering survival from increased metabolism as a result of warmer winters. Some species, particularly generalists with long flight periods, are likely to thrive with longer growing seasons and less severe winters and additional southern species are likely to migrate into Vermont in coming decades.
