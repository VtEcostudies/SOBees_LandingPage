The work reported on above represents countless hours of work from hundreds of Vermonters and members of the larger bee community. Each of the 50,000+ records that form the backbone of this report are by themselves a collaboration of multiple individuals and organizations. Each record starts with either a photograph or specimen collected in the field, often by a community volunteer or outside researcher working on their own project. Each record then needs to be identified by at least one expert taxonomist, who is basing their work on more than a century of prior taxonomic literature. Finally these records all need to be digitized and served to one of several open data platforms. The following people were instrumental in getting this project off the ground, compiling the data that makes it possible, and/or allowing access to the many special natural areas scattered throughout the state.
