<h4> Over 100 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops</h4>
</div>


250 species of bees have been recorded visiting at least 438 different plant species (in 92 families), with 10k bee-plant records generated, consisting of 1000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many species have only been documented in association with a single plant genus/species while other bees use a large number of unrelated plant species (max 50 plants documented for Bombus impatiens). Several plant genera (Salix, Physalis, etc) are used extensively by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology, or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit its value to generalist bees.

The pollination services that our agricultural systems rely on come from a variety of unrelated bees. Over 100 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops.
