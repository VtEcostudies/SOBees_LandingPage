Vermont has the highest per-capita engagement with <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/places/vermont-us" target=blank_>iNaturalist</a> and far and away the highest proportion of bee species that have been recorded on the platform (49% vs. ~20% nationally). This (and similar platforms) are likely to continue to grow and become the largest and fastest source of data on bee distributions and phenology. 1435 people have submitted photos, including several that were new species for the state.
