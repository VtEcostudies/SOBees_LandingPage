<h4> 
At least 8 species have been recorded in Vermont that are not known from elsewhere in New England.

Investigations of the bee fauna of all three neighboring states have recently been completed. However, only the Massachusetts publication was taxonomically complete, and much of the raw data used in all three publications is not available online.  Roughly 125 species are known from New England that havenâ€™t been found in VT. Many of these species are southern and coastal and unlikely to occur here, though we considered 30-50 species possible. 

As the northwestern most state in New England, VT does have a component of western species (i.e <i>Andrena chromotricha, Osmia texana, Megachile rugifrons, Epeolus canadensis, Epeolus minimus, Perdita maculigera, Triepeolus simplex, Svastra obliqua</i>) not found elsewhere in the region.  Despite targeted survey efforts, records of truly boreal species are few, though the cooler parts of the state have a relatively distinct bee community, characterized by several species that are uncommon to rare south of the conifer-hardwood transition zone.
