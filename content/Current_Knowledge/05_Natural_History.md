Even within a single genus, there can be significant variation in nesting substrate, phenology, social structure, and diet with implications for both sampling methodology and conservation recommendations. For most species, we know, or can reasonably infer, nesting substrate, and parasitism, but beyond that, many species remain largely unknown. For nearly half (38/87) of the cleptoparasitic bees in VT, no host has been reported in the literature. Without host information, targeted investigations of these species is trickly, let alone any conservation actions. 
Among the pollen collecting species, we have gathered flower visitation records for 87% leaving 45 species without known Vermont flower associations. Nests have been described for a number of species though much remains to be learned about the specific requirements and threats for this crucial part of a species life cycle.
