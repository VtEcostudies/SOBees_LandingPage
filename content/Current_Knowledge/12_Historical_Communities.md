Without more information about the historical bee community in Vermont, it is difficult to identify trends and designate a goal for any restoration.  The 4,254 records we have located from the 20th century provide some insight into past bee communities in the state, but are woefully incomplete. Obviously it is impossible to survey long-gone bees, but additional specimen records exist in many museums throughout the country (and possibly the world) which certainly hold new insights that remain inaccessible until the records can be digitized. Even print photographs from the late 20th century could provide novel information about field-identifiable species, such as the now extirpated Rusty-patched Bumble Bee.
