<h4> 
We were able to assign S-ranks to 334 species, providing one of very few taxon-wide conservation assessments for bees in a US state. 
</h4>
</div>

Fifty-eight species received a rank of S1 (Critically Imperiled), many of which have only been recorded in Vermont once or twice. Thirty-five species have been recorded frequently enough and from a broad enough area that we consider them S5 (Secure). More occurrence records and threat assessments are needed to improve upon these rankings and clarify many species' uncertain ranks or to rank species that are currently unrankable.
