<h4> More than half of Vermont's 350+ bee species were not recorded prior to 1960 </h4>

In 2012, the Vermont Bumble Bee Atlas (VBBA) began a multi-year effort to assess the statewide status of the 17 Bumble Bee (*Bombus*) species historically known from Vermont. Both the VBBA and the later Vermont Wild Bee Survey (VWBS) combed through museum specimens and other historical records to piece together a historical record of the bee community in the state. 

**Vermont's bee community is far from static.** Several exotic species are expected to become established in the near future. Changes within the native fauna are also happening, though are often less apparent.
