Bees (<i>Hymenoptera</i>, Epifamily <i>Anthophila</i>) are a diverse and ecologically important insect group, with <b>over 350 species in Vermont</b> including parasitic, solitary, and social species. As one of the major pollinating taxa, they provide crucial ecological and agricultural services. 

High-profile declines in a few species has led to concern about the collapse of the entire group, though our understanding of the status, threats, and natural history of most species is incredibly limited.
