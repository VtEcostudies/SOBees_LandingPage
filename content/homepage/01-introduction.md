Bees (hymenoptera, Epifamily Anthophila) are a diverse and ecologically important insect group, with over 350 species in Vermont including parasitic, solitary, and social species. As one of the major pollinating taxa, they provide crucial ecological and agricultural services. High-profile declines in a small number of species has led to concern about collapse of the taxa as a whole, though our understanding of the status, threats, and even the natural history of most species is incredibly limited.
