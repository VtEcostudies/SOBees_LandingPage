Bees have been recording visiting more than 600 different plant species, with 10k bee-plant records generated, consisting of 1000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many species have only been documented in association with a single plant genus/species while other bees use a large number of unrelated plant species (max 50 plants documented for Bombus impatiens). Several plant genera (Salix, Physalis, etc) are primarily visited by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology,  or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit its value to generalist bees.
