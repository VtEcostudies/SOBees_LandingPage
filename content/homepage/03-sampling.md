Bees have been recorded in every biophysical region and nearly every town. However, sampling effort is far from uniform across the state. Recent sampling has been heavily concentrated around the population centers in Chittenden and Washington counties, while historical collecting is heavily biased geographically by a small number of prolific collectors based in East Dorset, Middlebury, and  Castleton.
A concerted effort has been made to visit the full spectrum of habitats across the state. However, bee
diversity is heavily concentrated in select habitats, and habitats thought to support limited bee diversity have been deprioritized.
