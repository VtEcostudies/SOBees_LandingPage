Important bee areas, or IBeeAs for short were delined using the following criteria. 
 <ol>
  <li>Support multiple rare or local bee species, with an emphasis on specialists and regionally rare species</li>
  <li>Habitats that are geographically limited in the state, threatened by human impacts, and/or of regional significance</li>
  <li>Extensive areas of relatively pristine and unique habitat</li>
</ol> 

Priority survey areas are areas with unique habitats or undersampled regions that we've identified. These priority ares require additional surveys to assess the bee populations. Several locations throughout Vermont harbor unique bee communities.
