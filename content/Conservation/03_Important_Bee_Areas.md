<h4> 
12 Important Bee Areas (IBeeA’s) for potential protection and bee-focused management
</h4>
</div>

Building on the concept of Important Bird Areas (Birdlife International), we propose the following areas as Important Bee Areas. These parts of the state have been identified as containing regionally rare species and/or examples of high-quality habitat for a large number of Vermont’s bees. Occurrence data used to generate this list comes primarily from sampling conducted between 2019 and 2021 and thus is heavily biased towards sites with public access that were visited repeatedly during this project. Regardless, we believe this list is a meaningful step in identifying the areas of the state  most crucial to conserving the full diversity of bees found in Vermont. All of these areas contain a mix of conserved, public land and privatly owned land, and each with a unique set of threats and conservation priorities. More detailed management suggestions are in the works for many of the habitats and species covered by these IBeeAs, but its not too early for land managers to be considering rare bees in future management decisions.

<b><u>Important bee areas</u></b>, or IBeeAs for short were delineated using the following criteria:
 
 <ol>
  <li>Support multiple rare or local bee species, with an emphasis on specialists and regionally rare species</li>
  <li>Habitats that are geographically limited in the state, threatened by human impacts, and/or of regional significance</li>
  <li>Extensive areas of relatively pristine and unique habitat</li>
</ol> 

<b><u>Priority survey Regions</u></b> are areas with unique habitats or undersampled regions that we've identified. These priority regions require additional surveys to assess bee populations. Several locations throughout Vermont harbor unique bee communities.
