<h4> Since the vast majority of the state is privately owned, the future of Vermont’s bees is largely dependent on individuals and the management decisions made on everything from the ¼ acre lot to the 400 acre farm. </h4>

Thanks to campaigns like No Mow May and Bee City USA, there is a growing interest in backyard bee conservation and a recognition that bee habitat is often compatible with human habitat. Pollinator gardens are one of most widely recognized ways to “save the bees”, though hedgerows and wild strips are often easier and more effective ways. Many resources for building backyard bee habitat exist, some of which are compiled here: https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/pollinator-habitat/

While there is a lot that a landowner can do to actively encourage native bees, there is also a lot that inadvertently hurts native bees. Clearing of native shrubs, frequent mowing, and pesticide treatments are all likely to be harmful, as are a number of less obviously detrimental activities. Many nurseries sell plants that have been pre-treated with neonicotinoids, which are potentially toxic for visiting bees and other insect herbivores - ask about any treatments before you buy. Perhaps even more threatening, many companies are now selling live mason and leafcutter bees with bee hotels that can be installed in a garden to “increase the local bee population". Live bees (other than honey bees) should never be purchased for release, with the possible exception of bumble bee colonies for fruit or vegetable farms where there has been a demonstrated need. The interstate sale of mason and leafcutter bees appears to be entirely unregulated, despite a significant chance of spreading non-native bees, pathogens, and/or parasites, all of which have been shown to have negative consequences for native bee populations.
