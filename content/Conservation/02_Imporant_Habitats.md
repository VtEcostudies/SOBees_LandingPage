Since many are closely tied to individual flower species or genera, planting and encouraging flowers that support threatened bees is both scalable and actionable. Other habitats such as mature hardwoods and sandpits are known to support unique bee communities, and deserve consideration when planning bee-focused conservation actions. The following  list of plant communities or other habitats support a high proportion of unique and/or imperiled bee species.

<b>Sandpits</b>

The presence of exposed, deep, and relatively pure sand is the strongest indicator of bee diversity at the site level. The ease of digging and lack of moisture retention are probably the biggest factors in the frequent dependence on sand, as both are advantageous for many ground-nesting species. Additionally, many unique flowering plants are also found at sandy sites, which likely has a non-negligible effect on the associated bee community. 
Unfortunately sandy soils are also prime development sites given the ease of landscaping and septic capacity. While some forms of development appear to be suitable for a number of rare bee species, the planting of lawn grasses and other ground cover may reduce the exposed soil available for nesting bees. Actively managed sandpits are among the most reliable places to find frequently disturbed sand and many of VT’s sand obligates (bees, tiger beetles, other insects, and Sand Martins), but these are often considered unsightly and targeted for “restoration”. Additionally, sand pits have been proposed by Regional Planning Commissions as priority sights for large scale solar development. Given the limited number of sand deposits in the state and the high proportion of rare bees dependent on this habitat, this should be a major conservation priority in the immediate future. Bee (or other sand associate) conservation may look different than more traditional conservation, as some human mediated disturbance is probably important to maximize nest site availability and floral resources in the vicinity. 

<b>Loosestrife and Dogbane</b>
The genus Macropis is another group that should be a target of conservation efforts. All three species in eastern North America are specialists on Lysimachia, though not all Lysimachia are suitable host plants. This genus is less common in contemporary collections than it is in historical collections (cite) and is the only host for Epeoloides pilosulus an RSGCN high concern species likely has occurred, and may still occur in Vermont. Patellate Yellow Loosestrife Bee (Macropis patellata) is an RSGCN high concern species that has been found twice recently at one location in Vermont but very few other sites globally. The site in Vermont is protected, but intentional management is likely needed to maintain a healthy population of Lysimachia at this site.

<b>Wetlands</b>
Prior to human clearing of forests, wetlands probably provided the largest and most stable open habitats in the northeast. Unlike the understory of mature forests, wetlands have substantial sun exposure throughout the growing season, which has significant implications for bee and flower diversity and abundance. Several wetland obligates (and many facultative wetland plants) are hosts to specialist bees. Pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata) and Water lilies (Family Nymphaeaceae) are both reported as host plants for uncommon to rare bee species - the Pickerelweed Longhorn (Melissodes apicatus) and Water-lily Sweat Bee (Lasioglossum nelumbonis) respectively. A number of other uncommon to rare bees appear to be associated with wetlands, but not particular flowers. The Nelumbo Masked Bee (Hylaeus nelumbonis), Ocean Grove Metallic-Sweat bee (Lasioglossum oceanicum), and several others appear to be confined to wetland habitats. Wooded wetlands often contain unique plants (Ilex verticillata, Kalmia angustifolia) and their associated bees (Colletes banksi, Andrena kalmiae) as well as abundant standing dead wood, which is an important nesting resource for many bees. 

<b>Power Right-Of-Ways</b>
Often maligned as ugly and fragmenting, power line corridors and other right-of-ways can support exceptionally high bee diversity, including a number of rare specialists. The specifics of the vegetation management regime have significant consequences for the plant (and therefore) the bee community that occupies these sites. Invasive plants such as Honeysuckle, buckthorn, reed canary grass, and many others can quickly overrun these sites and choke out native plants and specialist bees, though many introduced plants are frequent food for bumble bees and other native generalists. The following shrubs and forbs are often found along ROWs and support rare and/or specialist bees: Willows, Dogwoods (swinda group), Sheep Laurel, Maleberry, Fireweed, Brambles, Blueberries, and Yellow Loosestrifes. 

<b>Rich hardwoods</b>
Prior to European colonization, the northeastern US was dominated by old growth hardwood forests. While often overlooked in bee conservation efforts, mature forests provide a number of crucial resources for both specialists and generalists. Rotten logs, standing deadwood, and rodent burrows on the forest floor are all used as nesting sites by a number of different bee genera. Additionally, at least seven species in VT specialize in spring ephemerals or other woodland flowers. Finally, flowering trees including maples, hickory, chestnut, and basswood are attractive to many different bees, though often overlooked by, or inaccessible to, beewatchers. Andrena rehni, reportedly a chestnut specialist, was probably once widespread in northeastern forest. 
Despite an increase in forest cover in Vermont over the past century, this habitat is not without conservation concern. Historical pasture is unlikely to return to a forest with the same floral diversity as land that’s been in continuous forest plus on-going threats, primarily in the form of invasive species (earthworms, Emerald Ash Borer, garlic mustard, etc) are altering forest communities, likely to the detriment of forest-adapted bees. 

<b>Fens</b>
Andrena parnassiae is a specialist on Fen Grass (Parnassia), a fall blooming flower found in calcareous fens and river bank communities. Anecdotal reports suggest this plant is severely threatened in much of its range by development, nutrification, and invasive species. In Vermont, this flower and bee are regularly found at numerous sites but may be threatened by the same pressures in the future. 

<b>Community Gardens and Diversified Farms</b>
Though far from a natural community, small-scale fruit and vegetable farms are an important habitat for a number of rare and uncommon bees. Many farms and community gardens share a similar suite of flower plants and associated bees, including examples of both that are rare to absent in more natural habitats. Tomatillos and Ground Cherries (genus Physalis), Squash, Blueberries, and Sunflowers are all cultivated commercially in Vermont and support specialist bees. Several uncommon specialists appear to have healthy populations on local farms, though caution is warranted. Commercial techniques such as pesticides, frequent tillage, and pollenless sunflowers have the potential to attract but then negatively impact specialist bees and other native insects.
