Systematic inventorying of wild bees in Vermont is very new. Prior to 2012, all bee studies were either haphazard or limited in scope and duration. In 2012 the Vermont Bumble Bee Atlas (VBBA) began a multi-year effort to assess the statewide status of the 17 Bumble Bee (Bombus) species historically known from VT. Seven years later, the Vermont Wild Bee Survey (VWBS) expanded on this effort to the other 35+ genera of wild bees. Both projects amassed more than ten thousand occurrence records which provide the first comprehensive, statewide baseline. 

Both the VBBA and the later the VWBS also combed through museum specimens and other historical records to piece together a picture of the historical bee community in the state. The earliest known records are from the second half of the 19th century, but more than half the 350+ species in the state were not recorded prior to 1960. 
After the 3 years of the VBBA and 4 years of VWBS, the list of species known appears to be stabilizing and basic abundance and distribution data is available for most of the species currently present. There are certainly still species within the state that have not been documented, and the status of others remains unclear. Additionally, the bee community is far from static. Several exotic species are known from neighboring states and expected to become established in the near future. Changes within the native fauna are also happening, though are often less readily apparent. Ten years of standardized bumble bee surveys showed gradual, but significant changes in species diversity and relative abundance of many species. An update on the VBBA is in preparation. 

Bees have been recorded in every biophysical region and nearly every town (n = 253 of 255). However, sampling effort is far from uniform across the state. Recent sampling has been heavily concentrated around the population centers in Chittenden and Washington counties, while historical collecting was biased geographically by a small number of prolific collectors based in East Dorset, Middlebury, and Castleton.

A concerted effort has been made to visit the full spectrum of habitats across the state. However, bee 
diversity is heavily concentrated in select habitats, and habitats thought to support limited bee diversity have been deprioritized, as have private lands without public access.
