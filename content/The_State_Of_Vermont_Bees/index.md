## Current Knowledge

<div class="row">
<div class="column">
More than 350 wild bee species have been recorded in Vermont, 70 of which were first documented in the past four years (2019-2022).  While we now have a relatively geographically and taxonomically complete assessment of the state's fauna, we have very little historical data and woefully inadequate natural history knowledge of most species.

## Threats
Reports of insect declines are widespread, real, and worrying. The causes of these declines are not fully understood and likely vary by taxa, but climate change, land use change, and introduced species (plants and pathogens) are all thought to negatively impact wild and cultivated bee populations. 


##  Conservation
Through a combination of modeling and field work, we have identified areas of the state that support unique, threatened and/or highly diverse communities of bees. While many of these sites are conserved, rare bees are generally not included in management plans and could potentially benefit from targeted management of foraging and nesting resources.
