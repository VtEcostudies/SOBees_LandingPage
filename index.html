For most species, we know, or can reasonably infer, nesting substrate, and parasitism, but beyond that, many species remain largely unknown. For nearly half (38/87) of the cleptoparasitic bees in VT, no host has been reported in the literature. Without host information, targeted investigations of these species is trickly, let alone any conservation actions.
Among the pollen collecting species, we have gathered flower visitation records for 87% leaving 45 species without known Vermont flower associations. Nests have been described for a number of species though much remains to be learned about the specific requirements and threats for this crucial part of a species life cycle.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=bee-flower-interactions class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Bee-Flower Interactions</h2></header><section class=post-content><div class=lead><h4>Over 100 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops</h4></div><p>250 species of bees have been recorded visiting at least 438 different plant species (in 92 families), with 10k bee-plant records generated, consisting of 1000 unique bee-flower combinations.

Despite targeted survey efforts, records of truly boreal species are few, though the cooler parts of the state have a relatively distinct bee community, characterized by several species that are uncommon to rare south of the conifer-hardwood transition zone.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=historical-communities class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Historical Communities</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Without more information about the historical bee community in Vermont, it is difficult to identify trends and designate a goal for any restoration. The 4,254 records we have located from the 20th century provide some insight into past bee communities in the state, but are woefully incomplete. Obviously it is impossible to survey long-gone bees, but additional specimen records exist in many museums throughout the country (and possibly the world) which certainly hold new insights that remain inaccessible until the records can be digitized. Even print photographs from the late 20th century could provide novel information about field-identifiable species, such as the now extirpated Rusty-patched Bumble Bee.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=causes-of-declines class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Causes Of Declines</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Given that information about long-term population trends is nearly nonexistent, it&rsquo;s probably not surprising that very little empirical data is available that demonstrates causes of the declines we have identified.

Two other species (Colletes consors and Dianthidium simile) are known only from historical records. Of the remaining 11 species, all but Megachile rugifrons are specialists with narrow diets or parasitic species with specialist hosts. While this specialization increases the extinction threat, it also provides an opportunity for targeted conservation actions. All ten specialist RSGCN species that are considered extant in Vermont should be benefited by preservation of the habitats spelled out in the Conservation priorities section.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><p style=text-align:center><b>Partners:</b><br></p><a href=https://vtfishandwildlife.com/ target=blank_><img src=images/VFW-Logo-RGB_transparent-background_0.png style=height:50px;width:50px></a>
