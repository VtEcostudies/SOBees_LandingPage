As one of the major pollinating taxa, they provide crucial ecological and agricultural services. High-profile declines in a small number of species has led to concern about collapse of the taxa as a whole, though our understanding of the status, threats, and even the natural history of most species is incredibly limited.</p><p>Learn more <a href=The_State_Of_Vermont_Bees>here</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=what-we-know class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>What We Know</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Systematic inventorying of wild bees in Vermont is very new. Prior to 2012, all non-honeybee studies were either haphazard or limited in scope and duration. In 2012 the Vermont Bumble Bee Atlas (VBBA) began a multi-year effort to assess the statewide status of the 17 Bumble Bee (Bombus) species historically known from VT. Both the VBBA and the later Vermont Wild Bee Survey (VWBS) combed through museum specimens and other historical records to piece together a picture of the historical bee community in the state. The earliest known records are from the second half of the 19th century, but more than half the 350+ species in the state were not recorded prior to 1960.
After the 3 years of the VBBA and 4 years of VWBS, the list of species known appears to be stabilizing and basic abundance and distribution data is available for most of the species currently present. There are certainly still species within the state that have not been documented, and the status of others remains unclear. Additionally, the bee community is far from static. Several exotic species are known from neighboring states and expected to become established in the near future. Changes within the native fauna are also happening, though are often less readily apparent. Ten years of standardized bumble bee surveys showed gradual, but significant changes in species diversity and relative abundance of many species. An update on the VBBA is in preparation.</p><p><img src=images/Bombus-griseocollis.jpg alt="Bombus griseocollis"></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=where-weve-sampled class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Where We’ve Sampled</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Bees have been recorded in every biophysical region and nearly every town. However, sampling effort is far from uniform across the state. Recent sampling has been heavily concentrated around the population centers in Chittenden and Washington counties, while historical collecting is heavily biased geographically by a small number of prolific collectors based in East Dorset, Middlebury, and Castleton.
A concerted effort has been made to visit the full spectrum of habitats across the state. However, bee
diversity is heavily concentrated in select habitats, and habitats thought to support limited bee diversity have been deprioritized.</p><p><img src=images/Bombus-borealis.jpg alt="Bombus borealis"></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=bee-flower-interactions class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Bee-Flower Interactions</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Bees have been recording visiting more than 600 different plant species, with 10k bee-plant records generated, consisting of 1000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many species have only been documented in association with a single plant genus/species while other bees use a large number of unrelated plant species (max 50 plants documented for Bombus impatiens). Several plant genera (Salix, Physalis, etc) are primarily visited by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology, or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit its value to generalist bees.</p><p><img src=images/Bombus-fervidus.jpg alt="Bombus fervidus"></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=species-interactions class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Species Interactions</h2></header><section class=post-content><div style=width:100%;height:100%><iframe src=https://vt-ecostudies-atlas.shinyapps.io/wildbee_interactions height=100% width=100% allowtransparency=true></iframe></div></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=important-bee-areas class='post last'><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Important Bee Areas</h2></header><section class=post-content><div style=width:100%;height:100%><iframe src=https://missions.vtatlasoflife.org/ImportantBeeAreas.html height=100% width=100% allowtransparency=true></iframe></div></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-scroll/>Design</a> template
